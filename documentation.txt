🍅 TOMATO LEAF DISEASE DETECTION
===============================

📘 PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
This project is a web-based application that helps identify different types of tomato leaf diseases using Deep Learning.
It is built using FLASK (for the web interface) and TENSORFLOW (for the trained CNN model).

The goal of this system is to make it easy for anyone — even without technical knowledge — to upload a tomato leaf image
and instantly get a prediction of whether it’s healthy or infected, and with what kind of disease.

Additionally, the system also evaluates the model’s accuracy and performance on test or validation data and presents
the results in a clear and visual manner.

This project brings Machine Learning and Agriculture together, helping farmers and researchers diagnose plant diseases early.


🧠 HOW IT WORKS (IN SIMPLE TERMS)
---------------------------------
1. The trained model file (tomato_model.h5) is loaded.
2. A user uploads a tomato leaf image from the web interface.
3. The system pre-processes the image (resizes it to 224x224 pixels and normalizes the values).
4. The model predicts the probability of each disease class.
5. The class with the highest probability becomes the final prediction.
6. The result (disease name and confidence percentage) is shown on the website.

Additionally, before the Flask app starts, the program automatically checks the model’s accuracy on test data, 
prints performance reports, and generates beautiful plots (confusion matrix and bar charts).


💻 FILES AND FOLDERS
--------------------
1. app.py
   - The main Python file that runs the Flask web server and connects everything.
   - Contains both the image prediction logic and model evaluation logic.

2. tomato_model.h5
   - The trained Deep Learning model saved in Keras HDF5 format.
   - This model understands and classifies tomato leaf diseases.

3. tomato_dataset/
   - Folder that contains the dataset (train/test/validation folders).
   - Each subfolder represents one disease category, for example:
       → Bacterial_Spot
       → Early_Blight
       → Late_Blight
       → Healthy
     The model uses these folders to identify which disease corresponds to each image.

4. static/uploads/
   - Where uploaded images are temporarily stored before prediction.

5. templates/index.html
   - The web page shown to the user.
   - Contains the upload form and displays the predicted results beautifully.


🌿 HOW THE FLASK APP WORKS
--------------------------
1. The app starts by loading the trained model.
2. When you visit the webpage (http://127.0.0.1:5000/), you can upload a leaf image.
3. Once uploaded, the image is saved to the "static/uploads" folder.
4. The model processes the image and predicts the disease type.
5. The result is shown along with a confidence percentage.

For example:
   Prediction: Early Blight
   Confidence: 98.7%


📊 MODEL EVALUATION EXPLAINED
-----------------------------
Before starting the app, the script automatically runs an evaluation on your test or validation dataset.

This evaluation shows:
- Overall model accuracy (example: 96.45%)
- Detailed classification report:
     • Precision → How many predicted positives are actually correct.
     • Recall → How many actual positives were correctly identified.
     • F1-score → A balance between Precision and Recall.

The results are printed in the terminal and visualized through:
- Confusion Matrix: A heatmap showing correct vs wrong predictions.
- Bar Graphs: Comparing Precision, Recall, and F1-score for each class.


⚙️ HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
-------------------------
Step 1️⃣ – Make sure you have Python installed.
Step 2️⃣ – Open a terminal or command prompt.
Step 3️⃣ – Navigate to your project folder.
Step 4️⃣ – Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
Step 5️⃣ – Install required libraries:
           pip install tensorflow flask numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Step 6️⃣ – Place your model (tomato_model.h5) in the project folder.
Step 7️⃣ – Make sure your dataset folders (train/test/val) exist and are properly organized.
Step 8️⃣ – Run the app:
           python app.py
Step 9️⃣ – Open your browser and go to:
           http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Step 🔟 – Upload a tomato leaf image to get instant predictions!


🧩 KEY PYTHON MODULES USED
--------------------------
- Flask → Creates the web server and handles user interaction.
- TensorFlow / Keras → Loads and runs the trained Deep Learning model.
- NumPy → Handles mathematical operations and image arrays.
